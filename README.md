### 🧩 Tic Tac Toe AI
### Overview
This Tic Tac Toe AI project allows you to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer. The computer makes its moves intelligently to compete with the user. 🤖

### Features
1) Two-Player Mode: Play as Player "X" and "O" against each other.
2) AI Mode: Play against a computer with random move generation.
3) Dynamic Board: The board updates after every move, and the game continues until a player wins or the game is a draw.
### How It Works
The user enters their move (row and column).
The AI automatically makes its move.
The game continues until one of the players wins or all cells are filled (draw).

### 👁️ Face Recognition
### Overview
The Face Recognition system detects and recognizes faces from an image using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. 🤳

### Features
Face Detection: Detect faces in images using CNN-based models.
Face Matching: Compare detected faces with known faces and identify them.
Real-time Display: The resulting image with detected faces is displayed in real-time.
### Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

opencv-python: For image processing and drawing.
face_recognition: For detecting and recognizing faces.
### Sample Output
When the code is executed, you should see an image with rectangles drawn around detected faces and their names displayed if recognized.
