📚 Codesoft_AI_Intern_Projects
Welcome to the collection of exciting AI-based projects! 🎮🤖 Here you'll find three fascinating projects:

Tic Tac Toe AI: A simple Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent.
Face Recognition System: A face recognition system using OpenCV and face_recognition libraries.
Tamil Movie Recommendation System: A personalized movie recommendation system based on user preferences.
🧩 Tic Tac Toe AI
Overview
This Tic Tac Toe AI project allows you to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer. The computer makes its moves intelligently to compete with the user. 🤖

Features
Two-Player Mode: Play as Player "X" and "O" against each other.
AI Mode: Play against a computer with random move generation.
Dynamic Board: The board updates after every move, and the game continues until a player wins or the game is a draw.
How It Works
The user enters their move (row and column).
The AI automatically makes its move.
The game continues until one of the players wins or all cells are filled (draw).
👁️ Face Recognition
Overview
The Face Recognition system detects and recognizes faces from an image using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. 🤳

Features
Face Detection: Detect faces in images using CNN-based models.
Face Matching: Compare detected faces with known faces and identify them.
Real-time Display: The resulting image with detected faces is displayed in real-time.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

opencv-python: For image processing and drawing.
face_recognition: For detecting and recognizing faces.
🎬 Tamil Movie Recommendation System
Overview
The Tamil Movie Recommendation System provides personalized movie suggestions based on the user’s age, favorite movie genre, actor, and director. 🎥🍿

Features
User Input: The system takes input from the user for age, movie genre, favorite actor, and director.
Movie Filtering: Filters Tamil movies based on user preferences and suggests matching movies.
Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies that fit the user’s profile.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
🚀 How to Run the Projects
Running Tic Tac Toe AI:
Run the code directly in a Python environment.
Play against the AI or another player.
Running Face Recognition:
Install the required libraries (opencv-python, face_recognition).
Provide an image for face detection and recognition.
Running Tamil Movie Recommendation:
Load your Tamil movies dataset (Tamil_movies_dataset.csv).
Enter your preferences, and the system will recommend matching movies.
